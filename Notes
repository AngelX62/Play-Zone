  
constructor with desired attributes (parameters)

this keyword: to specify to java that we are referring to the field on the object that this method was called on
this refers to the randomPrize object.  
For example, take the randomPrize object and set its name to the value of the type variable being passed in
You can use this in any non-static methods and constructors
this can also be used to call a constructor


Why is passing arguments to a constructor useful?
To create different objects with different attributes
A constructor is a block of code similar to the method. It is called when an instance of the class is created
It is used to initialize an object
Every time a new object is created with the new() keyword, one constructor is called
